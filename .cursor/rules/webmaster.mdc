# Mastering Claude and Cursor for modern web development

This comprehensive guide reveals the most effective prompt engineering techniques for creating production-ready, visually stunning web applications using Claude AI and Cursor IDE. The research draws from official Anthropic documentation, shadcn.io's production-ready prompts, leading developer communities, and real-world implementations from 2024-2025. **The key finding: success with Claude hinges on structured prompting with XML tags, detailed context through specific references, and iterative refinement**—not vague requests. By treating Claude as a senior developer who needs comprehensive specifications rather than a magic solution, developers can achieve 2-5x productivity gains while maintaining code quality.

Modern web development with AI assistance has converged around a specific technology stack: Next.js 15 with App Router, React 18+, TypeScript in strict mode, Tailwind CSS for styling, shadcn/ui for components, and Framer Motion for animations. This stack represents current industry best practices and works exceptionally well with Claude's code generation capabilities. Cursor IDE has emerged as the fastest-growing AI-powered editor specifically because it integrates Claude at multiple levels—from intelligent Tab autocomplete to autonomous Agent mode that can search codebases, modify multiple files, and run tests iteratively. The combination of Claude's reasoning capabilities and Cursor's context management creates a development experience that fundamentally changes how web applications are built.

## How to structure prompts that generate production-ready code

Claude responds exceptionally well to prompts with clear hierarchical structure using XML tags, which were specifically included in its training data. The fundamental anatomy of an effective prompt includes five distinct sections: task context that defines Claude's role and the broad objective, specific instructions detailing exact requirements, examples showing desired input/output patterns when relevant, constraints and technical specifications, and explicit output format instructions. The golden rule: treat Claude like explaining to a new senior developer with zero context about your project. If a colleague unfamiliar with your codebase couldn't follow your prompt, Claude likely won't either.

**XML tags are critical for Claude** and dramatically improve output quality compared to plain text prompts. Use logical, intuitive tag names like `<instructions>`, `<requirements>`, `<example>`, `<code>`, and `<technical_constraints>`. Be consistent across prompts and nest tags hierarchically for complex content. For instance, when requesting a React component, structure your prompt as:

```xml
<task>
Create a React component for a user profile card
</task>

<requirements>
- Use TypeScript with strict mode
- Include responsive design for mobile, tablet, desktop
- Add hover animations with Framer Motion
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- Implement loading and error states
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
</requirements>

<technical_stack>
- React 18.2+
- TypeScript 5.0+
- Tailwind CSS 3.4+
- Framer Motion 11.x
- Next.js 15 (if applicable)
</technical_stack>

<example>
<input>
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "role": "Senior Developer",
  "avatar": "https://...",
  "bio": "Full-stack developer..."
}
</input>
<desired_output>
A card component with proper semantic HTML, ARIA labels, smooth transitions on hover, mobile-responsive layout, and TypeScript interfaces
</desired_output>
</example>

<output_format>
- Component file with full implementation
- TypeScript type definitions
- Usage example with props documentation
- Unit tests with React Testing Library
</output_format>
```

Chain of thought prompting encourages Claude to reason step-by-step before generating code, which dramatically reduces logic errors and improves architectural decisions. For complex tasks, explicitly request thinking with structured tags: "Think step-by-step before coding" or use `<thinking>` and `<answer>` tags to separate reasoning from output. This technique works particularly well for debugging, refactoring decisions, state management architecture, and API design where multiple approaches exist and trade-offs must be considered.

Prefilling Claude's response gives you control over output format and skips generic preambles. When you need JSON output, start Claude's response with the opening brace. For code-only responses, prefill with three backticks and the language identifier. This technique is especially powerful in Cursor IDE where you can structure prompts to generate exactly the format you need without extra conversation.

The most effective prompts balance specificity with conciseness—they're detailed about requirements but avoid unnecessary verbosity. Instead of saying "make it look nice," specify exact measurements, colors, behaviors, and technical requirements: "Create a primary CTA button with rounded corners (border-radius: 8px), blue background (#2563eb), white text, hover state that darkens to #1d4ed8, includes a subtle shadow (0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)), 44px tall for touch targets, smooth 200ms transition." This level of detail produces superior results because Claude understands exactly what you need.

## Frontend development prompts for React, Next.js, and modern CSS

React component prompts should always specify the framework version (React 18.2+), whether to use functional components with hooks, TypeScript requirements, state management approach, and accessibility needs. A professional React component template establishes you as an expert developer and sets expectations: "You are an expert React developer specializing in modern React 18+ patterns. Create a ProductCard component that displays product information with image, title, price, and add-to-cart functionality. Requirements: Accept props with proper TypeScript types (product object with id, name, image, price, inStock), show 'Out of Stock' overlay when unavailable, implement optimistic UI updates on cart addition, include hover effects and animations, make it fully keyboard accessible, use React.memo for performance optimization, support dark mode via CSS variables."

**Next.js 15 prompts require special attention** to App Router patterns versus the legacy Pages Router. shadcn.io provides an official Next.js prompt template that represents industry best practices: specify that you're using App Router with Server Components by default and Client Components only when needed for interactivity, implement Server Actions for mutations following React 19 patterns, use proper data fetching with async/await directly in Server Components, implement Suspense boundaries for loading states, and optimize for Core Web Vitals. Always specify Next.js version (14 or 15) because architectural patterns differ significantly between versions.

Server Components fundamentally change how you structure Next.js applications. When prompting for Server Components, specify that they should fetch data using async/await without useEffect, handle errors with error boundaries, use React Suspense for loading states, implement proper caching strategies with revalidation, and include TypeScript types for all props and data. For Client Components, explicitly mark them with the 'use client' directive, use them only for interactivity that requires browser APIs or React hooks like useState and useEffect, implement proper error handling, and optimize with React.memo or useMemo when appropriate.

Server Actions represent the modern approach to mutations in Next.js. Prompt for Server Actions by requesting: use of the 'use server' directive at function or file level, implementation of validation with Zod schemas before processing, type-safe responses with proper error handling, integration with your database layer, optimistic updates on the client side for instant feedback, rate limiting for public endpoints, and CSRF protection for security. This pattern eliminates the need for traditional API routes for many use cases and provides better type safety end-to-end.

Tailwind CSS prompts benefit from extreme specificity about utility classes and responsive design. Request components using Tailwind's utility-first approach with responsive modifiers (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:, 2xl:), dark mode support using the dark: prefix, state variants for hover, focus, active, and disabled states, and group or peer modifiers for related element styling. For instance: "Create a card component with base styles (rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800), responsive padding (p-4 md:p-6 lg:p-8), hover state (hover:shadow-xl hover:scale-105 transition-all duration-300), and proper contrast ratios for accessibility." The shadcn/ui component library provides excellent reference patterns because it's built entirely with Tailwind and follows best practices.

Modern CSS layouts leverage Flexbox and Grid with a mobile-first responsive approach. When requesting layouts, specify: use Flexbox for one-dimensional layouts (navigation bars, card content, centering), use CSS Grid for two-dimensional layouts (dashboards, galleries, complex page structures), implement gap for spacing instead of margins, use semantic HTML with proper landmark roles, include proper breakpoints with min-width media queries, and support both light and dark modes through CSS custom properties. For example: "Create a responsive product grid using CSS Grid: mobile displays single column, tablet shows 2 columns (sm:grid-cols-2), desktop shows 3 columns (md:grid-cols-3), large screens show 4 columns (lg:grid-cols-4). Use gap-6 for spacing, implement auto-fit with minmax for flexible sizing, include loading skeleton states, and ensure images use aspect-ratio for preventing layout shift."

CSS custom properties (variables) create maintainable design systems. Request comprehensive variable systems that include: color palette with primary, secondary, accent, and semantic colors (success, warning, error, info) each with shade variations (50-900), dark mode variants using prefers-color-scheme, typography scale with font families for heading, body, and monospace, font sizes from xs to 4xl, line heights and letter spacing, spacing scale from 0.25rem to 4rem, border radius values, box shadow elevation system, and transition durations with easing functions. This approach enables consistent theming across your application and easy implementation of dark mode.

## Animation and interaction prompts for modern user experiences

CSS animations provide the foundation for performant web interactions. When prompting for CSS animations, emphasize using only transform and opacity properties because these are GPU-accelerated and achieve smooth 60fps performance, unlike animating width, height, top, or left which cause layout recalculations. Request animations with: @keyframes definitions for complex sequences, transition properties for simple state changes, cubic-bezier or custom easing functions for natural motion feel, will-change declarations sparingly and only during animations, and mandatory prefers-reduced-motion media queries for accessibility compliance. For example: "Create a smooth fade-in animation for cards entering viewport: start with opacity 0 and translateY(30px), animate to opacity 1 and translateY(0) over 600ms with cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) easing, include @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) that removes transforms and uses only instant opacity change."

**Framer Motion has become the industry standard** for React animations with over 10 million monthly downloads. The library excels at declarative animations, gesture recognition, layout animations, and shared element transitions. shadcn.io provides an official Motion prompt template: "You are a Senior Motion Designer expert in React animations and Framer Motion. Create animations that maintain 60fps performance, respect prefers-reduced-motion, use transform and opacity for GPU acceleration, implement proper TypeScript types, and leave no TODOs or placeholders. Use motion components from framer-motion with initial, animate, and exit props for state-based animations, variants for reusable animation definitions, AnimatePresence for mount/unmount animations, and gestures like whileHover, whileTap, and drag for interactions."

Motion variants create reusable animation patterns across your application. Request variant systems that include: fadeIn animations (opacity 0 to 1 with optional y translation), slideIn animations from different directions (left, right, top, bottom), scaleIn animations (scale 0.95 to 1), and stagger configurations for list items. For instance: "Create fadeInUp variants: hidden state with opacity 0 and y 20, visible state with opacity 1 and y 0, transition with duration 0.6 seconds and ease [0.4, 0, 0.2, 1], and staggerChildren of 0.1 seconds when used in a parent container." These variants ensure consistent animation timing and style across your entire application.

GSAP (GreenSock) and ScrollTrigger provide timeline-based animations and scroll-driven effects that are particularly powerful for marketing sites and interactive experiences. When prompting for GSAP, specify: register ScrollTrigger plugin with gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger), use gsap.to() or gsap.from() for animations with proper easing functions (power2.out, power3.inOut, elastic), implement timeline-based sequences with gsap.timeline() for choreographed animations, configure ScrollTrigger with start, end, scrub, and pin properties, include proper cleanup in React useEffect return functions, and use markers: true during development for debugging. For scroll-triggered animations: "Create a horizontal scroll gallery with GSAP ScrollTrigger: pin the container, calculate total scroll width based on items, animate x position with scrub: 1 for smooth following, add snap points using snap: { snapTo: 1 / (items.length - 1) }, implement responsive breakpoints, reference Apple product page quality."

Scroll-based animations have evolved to use Intersection Observer API instead of scroll event listeners for better performance. Request scroll reveal implementations that: create IntersectionObserver with appropriate threshold (typically 0.3 for triggering at 30% visibility), configure rootMargin to trigger before elements enter viewport (like '-25% 0px' for earlier activation), add animated class when isIntersecting becomes true, include CSS transitions on the animated class (opacity and transform), unobserve elements after animation completes to prevent memory leaks, and implement cleanup functions in React components. Modern approaches combine Intersection Observer with GSAP or Framer Motion for smooth, performant scroll effects that don't block the main thread.

Micro-interactions represent current design trends and dramatically improve perceived polish. When requesting micro-interactions, specify subtle animations with durations between 200-400ms for snappy feel: button hovers with slight scale (1.05x) and shadow expansion, input focus with border color shift and subtle glow, toggle switches with spring physics for natural feel, checkbox animations with checkmark draw effects, loading states using skeleton screens or pulse animations instead of spinners, success feedback with gentle bounce combined with color change, and error states with horizontal shake animation. Reference quality standards: "Create micro-interactions matching Linear app or Stripe quality—subtle, purposeful, and enhancing rather than distracting from content."

## Backend development and API prompts for robust services

Node.js and Express backend prompts should emphasize production-ready patterns with security and scalability from the start. Structure backend prompts with clear architecture: "Create a Node.js microservice with Express for order processing. Implement endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting orders with: input validation using Zod schema library, repository pattern for database access separating data layer from business logic, middleware for authentication using JWT verification, comprehensive error handling with standardized JSON error responses, rate limiting with express-rate-limit to prevent abuse, request logging with correlation IDs for distributed tracing, health check endpoints for monitoring, proper TypeScript types throughout, environment variable configuration, and unit tests for services with integration tests for API endpoints using Supertest."

API development requires careful attention to REST principles and error handling. When requesting RESTful APIs, specify: proper HTTP method usage (GET for retrieval, POST for creation, PUT/PATCH for updates, DELETE for removal), appropriate status codes (200 for success, 201 for creation, 400 for validation errors, 401 for authentication failures, 403 for authorization issues, 404 for not found, 422 for semantic validation errors, 429 for rate limiting, 500 for server errors), pagination for list endpoints with limit, offset, and total count, filtering and sorting capabilities with query parameters, consistent response envelope format, comprehensive validation with descriptive error messages, CORS configuration for cross-origin requests, and OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation. For example: "Create REST API for user management with GET /api/users (paginated, filtered, sorted), GET /api/users/:id, POST /api/users with Zod validation, PUT /api/users/:id, DELETE /api/users/:id. Include authentication middleware checking JWT, rate limiting of 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP, standardized error responses with error code, message, details array, timestamp, and request path."

GraphQL APIs benefit from schema-first design with resolver-based architecture. Prompt for GraphQL implementations with: schema definition using GraphQL SDL with proper type definitions, resolver functions organized by domain with proper separation of concerns, DataLoader for batching and caching to solve N+1 query problems, authentication context passed through to resolvers, field-level authorization checking permissions before data access, error handling with custom error types, query complexity analysis to prevent abuse, pagination using Relay cursor connections or offset-based approaches, and integration with TypeScript using code generation tools like GraphQL Code Generator. "Build GraphQL API with Apollo Server 4 for book recommendation platform: define schemas for Book, Author, Genre with relationships, create resolvers with proper TypeScript types, implement authentication with context, add query complexity limiting, support pagination with connections, include DataLoader for efficient batching, generate TypeScript types, write integration tests."

Database integration patterns vary significantly between SQL and NoSQL approaches. For **PostgreSQL with Prisma**, request: schema definition in schema.prisma with proper relations using @relation directive, migration generation and management strategy, Prisma Client usage with type-safe queries, repository pattern abstracting Prisma calls, transaction support for multi-step operations, connection pooling configuration, error handling for unique constraints and foreign key violations, and soft deletes using deletedAt timestamp field. For **MongoDB**, specify: Mongoose schemas with proper validation, index definitions for query performance, aggregation pipelines for complex queries, reference vs embedded document decisions based on access patterns, connection handling with retry logic, and schema versioning strategy for migrations.

Authentication and authorization require meticulous attention to security. JWT authentication prompts should specify: password hashing with bcrypt using 12+ rounds, JWT generation with proper claims (sub for user ID, iss for issuer, aud for audience, exp for expiration set to 1 hour, scope for permissions), token verification middleware that validates signature and expiration, refresh token flow with longer expiration (7 days) stored encrypted in database with rotation on use, revocation support through token blacklist or database lookup, secure storage using httpOnly cookies with secure and sameSite attributes, CSRF protection using tokens, rate limiting on authentication endpoints (5 attempts per 15 minutes), and comprehensive audit logging. "Implement secure JWT authentication: registration with bcrypt hashing (12 rounds) and email validation, login returning access token (1 hour) and refresh token (7 days), middleware verifying JWT with proper error handling, refresh endpoint with token rotation, logout invalidating tokens, password reset flow with time-limited tokens, rate limiting on auth endpoints, never logging tokens, httpOnly secure cookies, CSRF protection."

OAuth 2.1 represents modern authentication standards with mandatory PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange). When implementing OAuth, request: discovery endpoints exposing authorization server metadata, authorization endpoint with PKCE code challenge and method support, consent screen showing requested scopes clearly, authorization code generation with short lifetime (10 minutes), token endpoint validating PKCE code_verifier against challenge, access token issuance (JWT or opaque) with proper claims, refresh token support for offline_access scope, token introspection endpoint for validation, security requirements including HTTPS only enforcement even in development, no client secrets for public clients, token encryption at rest, comprehensive audit logging, and proper error responses using OAuth error codes. This implementation pattern ensures secure delegated authorization for third-party applications.

## Library integration prompts for the modern JavaScript ecosystem

shadcn.io has emerged as the dominant UI component approach for 2024-2025, fundamentally different from traditional component libraries. Unlike Material-UI or Chakra that you npm install as dependencies, shadcn/ui copies components directly into your project where you own and can modify them. This approach provides **flexibility without abstraction overhead**. The official shadcn/ui prompts at shadcn.com/prompts provide production-ready templates: "Create a component using shadcn/ui with: Radix UI primitives for accessibility and behavior, Tailwind CSS for styling, TypeScript for type safety, class-variance-authority (CVA) for variant management, proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation support, dark mode with dark: prefix, responsive design, loading and error states." Components follow consistent patterns: Button with variants (default, destructive, outline, ghost, link) and sizes (default, sm, lg, icon), Form with React Hook Form integration and Zod validation, Dialog with AnimatePresence for animations, Sheet for slide-out panels, and comprehensive data tables with sorting, filtering, and pagination.

React Hook Form combined with Zod validation represents the standard form handling approach. Prompts for forms should request: Zod schema definition with validation rules and custom error messages, useForm hook configured with zodResolver for seamless integration, type inference using z.infer<typeof schema> for type safety, defaultValues preventing uncontrolled component warnings, handleSubmit wrapper with proper error handling, individual field registration with validation triggers, error display inline with helpful messages, submission states (idle, submitting, success, error), integration with shadcn/ui Form components for consistent styling, accessibility with proper labels and ARIA attributes, and comprehensive validation including cross-field validation with refine() or superRefine(). "Build user registration form with React Hook Form and Zod: schema with username (min 3, max 20 alphanumeric), email (valid format), password (min 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, number requirements), confirmPassword (must match password with refinement), age (18-100), terms (boolean that must be true). Use shadcn/ui Form components, show validation errors on blur, disable submit when invalid, implement optimistic loading state, show success toast on completion, TypeScript types inferred from schema."

State management has fragmented into complementary solutions rather than one approach for everything. **Zustand for client UI state** and **TanStack Query for server state** represent the modern separation of concerns. For Zustand stores, request: create() function from zustand with TypeScript interface, state shape with all necessary fields, actions that modify state with proper typing, middleware like persist for localStorage synchronization or devtools for debugging, selectors for optimized component subscriptions preventing unnecessary re-renders, and immer middleware for immutable updates if needed. "Create shopping cart store with Zustand: state containing items array (CartItem[] with id, name, price, quantity), total number, isLoading boolean. Actions for addItem accepting Product and quantity, removeItem by productId, updateQuantity, clearCart, and derived calculateTotal. Include persist middleware saving to localStorage, devtools for debugging, TypeScript interfaces, optimized selectors preventing re-renders, async action for syncing with backend."

TanStack Query (formerly React Query) has become the definitive solution for server state management. Prompts should specify: QueryClient configuration with default options for staleTime (5 minutes) and cacheTime (10 minutes), QueryClientProvider wrapping application, useQuery hooks with queryKey array as dependency and cache key, queryFn performing actual data fetch with proper error handling, loading/error/success state handling, useMutation for data modifications with onSuccess invalidating related queries, optimistic updates for instant UI feedback, pagination or infinite scroll patterns, prefetching on hover for improved perceived performance, and TypeScript generics for type-safe data. "Implement posts feature with TanStack Query: useQuery(['posts']) fetching all posts with staleTime 5 minutes, useQuery(['posts', postId]) for single post with dependent query pattern, createPost mutation with optimistic update adding post immediately to cache, updatePost mutation updating cache directly, deletePost mutation removing from cache, prefetching on post link hover, error boundaries for error handling, loading skeletons during pending, retry logic for failed requests, TypeScript interfaces for Post type."

Form validation with Zod provides runtime type safety and excellent developer experience. When requesting Zod schemas, specify: z.object() for object shape definition, appropriate types (z.string(), z.number(), z.boolean(), z.array(), z.enum()), validation methods chained on types (.min(), .max(), .email(), .url(), .regex()), custom error messages using object notation ({ required_error, invalid_type_error }), optional fields with .optional(), nullable fields with .nullable(), default values with .default(), transformations with .transform(), refinements for custom validation logic with .refine(), cross-field validation with .superRefine(), and discriminated unions with .discriminatedUnion() for complex conditional validation. These schemas integrate seamlessly with React Hook Form through zodResolver and provide full TypeScript type inference.

Icon libraries have converged on React-friendly solutions with Lucide React leading for its clean design, tree-shakeable imports, and active maintenance. Request icon usage with: specific icon imports from lucide-react, size prop for dimensions (typically 16, 20, 24), strokeWidth for line thickness (1.5-2.5), color set to "currentColor" for inheriting text color, className for additional styling with Tailwind, proper ARIA labels for accessibility (aria-label or aria-hidden="true" if decorative), integration with buttons and navigation, and responsive sizing. "Create navigation menu with Lucide icons: Home, User, Settings, Search, Menu, X, ChevronDown icons. Size 20 for desktop, 24 for mobile touch targets. Use currentColor for theme integration, add aria-label for screen readers, implement hover states changing color, group icons with text labels using Tailwind gap-2."

Chart libraries for data visualization center on Recharts for React projects, particularly when integrated with shadcn/ui Chart components. Request chart implementations with: ResponsiveContainer for responsive sizing across devices, appropriate chart type selection (LineChart for trends, BarChart for comparisons, PieChart for proportions, AreaChart for cumulative data), XAxis and YAxis with dataKey specifying which data field to plot, Tooltip component for interactive data display, Legend for identifying multiple data series, CartesianGrid for reference lines, custom colors matching design system, animations with animationDuration for smooth transitions, TypeScript interfaces for data structure, integration with TanStack Query for data fetching, loading skeleton states during data fetch, error boundaries for rendering failures, and responsive design with mobile-optimized tooltips. "Build dashboard with shadcn/ui Charts: line chart showing sales over last 30 days with dual y-axes (revenue and quantity), bar chart for top 10 products by revenue with custom colors, pie chart for category distribution with legend, KPI cards above charts showing totals, date range picker filtering data using date-fns, TanStack Query for data fetching with 5-minute cache, loading skeletons matching chart dimensions, responsive grid layout stacking on mobile, dark mode support."

## Cursor IDE workflows and context management for maximum productivity

Cursor IDE fundamentally reimagines development by integrating Claude at multiple levels rather than as an add-on. The **four primary interaction modes** serve distinct purposes: Tab provides intelligent multi-line autocomplete with diff previews showing insertions and deletions, learning from your accept/reject patterns to improve suggestions; Cmd/Ctrl+K enables inline editing for quick targeted changes to selected code, perfect for refactoring single functions or adjusting styles; Chat mode (Cmd/Ctrl+L) offers a read-only environment for asking questions, understanding code, and planning without making changes; and Composer/Agent mode (Cmd/Ctrl+I) provides autonomous capabilities to search codebases, read and write multiple files, run terminal commands, and iterate on test failures. Understanding when to use each mode dramatically impacts productivity—use Tab for incremental coding, Cmd+K for quick edits, Chat for learning and planning, and Agent for complex multi-file features.

Context management through Cursor's @ system represents the single most important technique for quality results. The @ prefix provides structured references: **@file or @files** includes specific files in your prompt enabling comparisons or style matching ("@components/Button.tsx create a similar LoadingButton component"), **@code** references specific functions or classes for targeted discussion, **@web** searches the web and includes results directly in context ("@web 'React Server Components best practices 2024'" fetches current information), **@terminal** includes terminal output essential for debugging error messages, **@docs** references indexed documentation from your project or added external docs, and **@codebase** performs semantic search across your entire project though should be used sparingly due to token usage. Mastering these references eliminates vague prompts—instead of "fix this," you say "Fix the TypeScript error in @components/Dashboard.tsx shown in @terminal, ensure types match @lib/api/tasks.ts interfaces."

Project configuration through .cursorrules files provides persistent context that Claude follows automatically without repeating instructions. Create a .cursorrules file in your project root defining: technology stack with specific versions (Next.js 15 App Router, TypeScript 5.0+ strict mode, Tailwind CSS 3.4+, Supabase for backend), code style preferences (functional components, async/await over promises, TypeScript interfaces over types, mandatory JSDoc comments), architectural patterns (component size limits under 200 lines, business logic in /lib folder, API routes in /app/api, Zod validation for all inputs), testing requirements (Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E, test coverage minimums), and common mistakes to avoid based on your experience. Start with 10-15 concise lines and expand as patterns emerge. The community provides excellent templates at cursor.directory and awesome-cursorrules GitHub repository covering popular frameworks and opinionated setups.

Agent mode represents Cursor's most powerful feature, enabling autonomous multi-file development. Enable **YOLO mode** in settings (Features → Chat & Composer → Enable YOLO mode) to allow Agent to run terminal commands without asking permission, dramatically speeding up test-driven workflows. Configure YOLO permissions to allow: any test commands (vitest, npm test, jest, pytest), basic build commands (build, tsc, lint), and file/directory creation (mkdir, touch). Then use prompts like "Write comprehensive tests for the authentication module, then implement the code, then run tests and fix all failures until passing—YOLO mode enabled." The Agent autonomously writes tests, implements code, runs tests, analyzes failures, fixes issues, and iterates until success, saving massive amounts of time on repetitive test-fix cycles.

Effective Cursor prompts for web development follow specific patterns. For feature implementation: "Implement user authentication with these requirements: 1) Create login form at /login with email/password fields, 2) Use Supabase Auth for authentication, 3) Implement session management with cookies, 4) Add protected route middleware in middleware.ts, 5) Create user context provider for auth state, 6) Add logout in header, 7) Include error handling and loading states, 8) Follow existing form patterns in @components/forms. Files to modify: app/login/page.tsx (create), middleware.ts, components/AuthProvider.tsx (create), components/Header.tsx. Use Zod validation and React Hook Form matching @components/ContactForm.tsx pattern." This level of detail ensures Claude understands exact requirements, affected files, patterns to follow, and technologies to use.

Test-driven development represents one of the most powerful Cursor workflows. Prompt with: "Create a function that converts markdown to HTML. Requirements: 1) Write comprehensive tests first covering basic markdown (headers, bold, italic), links and images, code blocks, and edge cases (empty input, invalid markdown). 2) Then implement the function. 3) Run tests and iterate until all pass. 4) Add JSDoc documentation. Use Vitest for testing. YOLO mode enabled—run tests automatically and fix failures without asking." This pattern leverages Agent mode's autonomous capabilities to handle the tedious test-fix iteration cycle while you review the final working result.

Incremental development prevents overwhelming AI with too much context at once. Break large features into phases: "Phase 1: Analyze the TaskManager component in @components/TaskManager.tsx and identify architectural issues. Phase 2: Extract business logic into custom hooks (useTasks, useTaskFilters). Phase 3: Split into smaller components (TaskList, TaskItem, TaskForm) with proper prop interfaces. Phase 4: Add TypeScript interfaces for all data types. Phase 5: Implement error boundaries and loading states. Phase 6: Write unit tests for each component. Do this incrementally—show me each phase for approval before proceeding." This approach maintains control while enabling AI to handle complex refactoring systematically.

Working with existing codebases requires deliberate onboarding. When joining a new project or using Cursor for the first time on a codebase: "I'm new to this codebase. Please: 1) Analyze the project structure in @codebase, 2) Identify the main architectural patterns (MVC, repository pattern, etc.), 3) Document the tech stack and key dependencies in TECH_STACK.md, 4) Explain the data flow for user authentication with sequence diagram, 5) Create CONTRIBUTING.md with development setup steps, testing procedures, and commit guidelines. Review major files: @app/layout.tsx @lib/database.ts @components/ui." This systematic exploration builds understanding before making changes, reducing errors from misunderstanding project patterns.

Performance optimization in Cursor centers on model selection and context management. Use **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** for most coding tasks as it provides the best balance of speed, quality, and cost. Reserve **Claude 4 Sonnet** for complex reasoning with large context requirements. Use **cursor-small** model for simple completions and iterations where speed matters more than capability. For context management, prefer specific @file references over @codebase searches which consume significant tokens, keep conversations focused with 5-10 message maximum before starting fresh, and commit frequently to avoid needing to regenerate large amounts of code if reverting changes.

## Essential patterns and best practices for creative, modern outputs

Modern web design in 2024-2025 centers on several key aesthetic and interaction patterns. **Glassmorphism effects** create depth with semi-transparent backgrounds and backdrop blur: request "backdrop-filter: blur(10px) saturation(180%), semi-transparent background rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1), subtle 1px border rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2), multi-layer box-shadow for depth, animate blur amount on hover, ensure fallback for unsupported browsers." **Micro-interactions** enhance perceived quality with subtle animations lasting 200-400ms: button hovers with scale 1.05x and shadow expansion, input focus with border color shift and glow, checkbox with checkmark draw animation, loading states with skeleton screens, success feedback with gentle bounce, error states with horizontal shake. Reference quality standards from Linear, Stripe, or Framer to set clear expectations.

Scroll-triggered reveal animations represent current best practices, replacing older approaches. Request implementations using Intersection Observer for performance: "Create scroll reveal animation: 1) Configure IntersectionObserver with threshold 0.3 triggering at 30% visibility, 2) Set rootMargin: '-25% 0px' for earlier activation before fully visible, 3) Add 'animate' class when isIntersecting adding opacity: 1 and translateY(0), 4) Initial state opacity: 0 and translateY(30px), 5) CSS transition: all 0.6s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1), 6) Stagger delays for multiple elements (100ms increments), 7) Include prefers-reduced-motion removing transforms, 8) Unobserve after animation completes, 9) Implement cleanup in React useEffect." This pattern provides smooth, performant reveals without scroll event listeners blocking the main thread.

Accessibility compliance should be default in all prompts, not an afterthought. Include requirements for: keyboard navigation with proper Tab order and visible focus indicators, ARIA attributes (aria-label for icon buttons, aria-describedby for form help text, aria-live for dynamic content, aria-expanded for disclosure widgets), color contrast ratios meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text and UI components), semantic HTML using appropriate elements (header, nav, main, section, article, aside, footer), form accessibility with associated labels using for/id, clear error messages, focus management especially in modals and dialogs, and screen reader testing with actual tools like NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver. Specify: "Ensure full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance: keyboard navigation with logical tab order, visible focus rings (not outline: none without replacement), proper ARIA labels on interactive elements, color contrast tested with Chrome DevTools, semantic HTML with landmark roles, form labels properly associated, modals trap focus and return on close, test with screen reader for verification."

Responsive design prompts should emphasize mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement. Specify breakpoints explicitly matching Tailwind's conventions: mobile as default (< 640px), tablet with sm: prefix (640px+), desktop with md: (768px+) and lg: (1024px+), large screens with xl: (1280px+) and 2xl: (1536px+). Request layouts that: stack vertically on mobile then shift to multi-column on larger screens, adjust typography scaling (text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg), modify spacing responsively (p-4 md:p-6 lg:p-8), show/hide elements based on screen size (hidden md:block for desktop-only navigation, md:hidden for mobile-only hamburger menu), and test on actual devices not just browser resize. "Create responsive dashboard: mobile shows single column with hamburger navigation, statistics cards stack vertically. Tablet (sm:) displays 2-column grid with persistent sidebar. Desktop (lg:) shows 3-column layout with expanded sidebar, larger typography. Charts scale smoothly using ResponsiveContainer. Test on iPhone SE, iPad, and desktop monitors."

Design system prompts create consistency across applications. Request comprehensive systems including: color palette with primary, secondary, accent, and semantic colors (success, warning, error, info) each with 50-900 shades, typography scale using modular scale ratio (1.2 for mobile, 1.25 for desktop) defining sizes from xs (0.75rem) to 4xl (3rem), spacing scale using consistent increments (0.25rem base with multiples: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64), component variants using CVA (class-variance-authority) for buttons, cards, badges, elevation system with shadow scales (xs through 2xl), border radius values (sm: 0.125rem, DEFAULT: 0.25rem, md: 0.375rem, lg: 0.5rem, xl: 0.75rem, 2xl: 1rem, full: 9999px), and animation tokens (duration: 150ms, 200ms, 300ms, 500ms with easing functions). "Create design system config for Tailwind: extend theme with brand colors (primary #2563eb through shades, accent #f59e0b), typography using Inter for sans and JetBrains Mono for code, spacing scale, custom shadow elevations, animation durations, consistent border radius, dark mode variants for all colors, document usage guidelines."

Component composition over configuration represents modern React patterns. Instead of components with dozens of props, create composable pieces: "Build Card component system using composition pattern: Card root container with padding and border, CardHeader for title area with optional action slot, CardContent for main content with prose styling, CardFooter for actions with button group, CardImage for media with aspect-ratio. Each exported separately. Use children prop for content. Apply styles with Tailwind. TypeScript interfaces for each component. Example usage showing composed card with header, image, content, and footer demonstrating flexibility without prop explosion." This pattern provides maximum flexibility while maintaining consistency and reducing API surface area.

Performance optimization should be requested explicitly for production applications. Specify: code splitting with React.lazy() and Suspense for route-based splitting, dynamic imports for heavy components loaded on interaction, image optimization using Next.js Image component with proper sizes and priority for LCP images, font optimization with font-display: swap and preloading critical fonts, bundle analysis with @next/bundle-analyzer identifying large dependencies, memoization using React.memo for expensive renders, useMemo for heavy computations, useCallback for preventing function recreation, virtualization with react-window or react-virtual for long lists (1000+ items), debouncing search inputs and throttling scroll handlers, and proper cache headers for static assets. "Optimize application for production: implement code splitting for routes, lazy load ChartComponent only when analytics page accessed, optimize hero image with next/image (priority, quality 85, sizes for responsive), add React.memo to ProductCard preventing re-renders, virtualize ProductList supporting 10,000+ items with react-window, debounce search input by 300ms, analyze bundle with webpack-bundle-analyzer, target Lighthouse score 90+ for all metrics."

## Synthesizing knowledge into production workflows

Complete feature implementation requires orchestrating all the patterns and techniques covered. Consider building an e-commerce product page: "Build production-ready product page using Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. Tech stack: React 18.2+, TanStack Query for data, Zustand for cart state, Framer Motion for animations, Zod validation. Features: product image gallery with zoom and thumbnails using Framer Motion AnimatePresence for transitions, variant selection (size, color) with visual feedback and sold-out states, add-to-cart with quantity selector implementing optimistic updates, price display showing discounts and calculating savings, product details tabs (description, specifications, reviews) with proper ARIA roles, related products carousel with drag gesture support, breadcrumb navigation with structured data, social sharing buttons with Web Share API fallback. Technical implementation: Server Component for initial data fetch with type-safe props, Client Components for interactivity marked 'use client', optimistic UI updating cart immediately while background mutation executes, image optimization with next/image using priority for LCP image, accessibility-compliant controls with keyboard navigation and ARIA labels, mobile-responsive with touch gestures for gallery, SEO-optimized with JSON-LD structured data (Product schema), dark mode support throughout. Architecture: /app/products/[id]/page.tsx as Server Component fetching data, /components/product/ProductGallery.tsx client component with animations, /components/product/VariantSelector.tsx with Zod validation, /lib/api/products.ts containing fetch functions, /stores/cart.ts Zustand store with persist middleware, /types/product.ts TypeScript interfaces. Include loading.tsx with skeleton matching final layout, error.tsx with error boundary, comprehensive tests for cart logic, and Lighthouse score target of 90+ across all metrics."

Integration patterns for combining multiple technologies require careful orchestration. The modern stack separates concerns appropriately: TanStack Query manages server state (API data, cached responses, background refetching), Zustand handles client UI state (filters, modals, temporary selections), Context API provides cross-cutting concerns (theme, authentication status), forms use React Hook Form with Zod validation, styling uses Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components, animations use Framer Motion for React-specific features, and icons come from Lucide React. When prompting for features touching multiple libraries: "Build product filtering system: TanStack Query fetching products with filter parameters (category, price range, rating), Zustand store maintaining current filter selections persisted to localStorage, URL synchronization pushing filter state to query parameters, shadcn/ui Select and Slider components for filter UI, React Hook Form managing filter form with Zod schema validation, Framer Motion stagger animation for filtered results appearing, responsive design collapsing filters to modal on mobile, loading skeleton during fetch, empty state when no results, clear filters button, TypeScript types throughout." This prompt clearly delineates which library handles each concern.

The decision framework for library selection depends on project scale and requirements. For UI components, shadcn/ui with Radix UI and Tailwind represents the current standard across project sizes due to flexibility and ownership of code. For forms, React Hook Form with Zod dominates because of performance, developer experience, and type safety. State management splits based on type: always use TanStack Query for server state, use Context API for simple client state in small projects, Zustand for medium to large client state needs, and Redux Toolkit only for large enterprise projects requiring strict patterns and extensive middleware. For styling, Tailwind CSS has become the default with Emotion or Styled Components as alternatives when runtime theming or complex dynamic styles are needed. These decisions reflect industry convergence around specific solutions that balance developer experience with production requirements.

Debugging and iteration patterns follow specific approaches. When AI-generated code has issues: "I'm getting a TypeScript error on line 47 of @components/Dashboard.tsx. Error from @terminal shows: [paste full error with stack trace]. The component fetches data from @lib/api/tasks.ts and uses types from @types/task.ts. Please: 1) Analyze the type mismatch identifying the exact incompatibility, 2) Explain why this is happening and the root cause, 3) Show the fix with proper types including updated interfaces if needed, 4) Verify all related files are updated consistently (TaskList, TaskItem consuming this data), 5) Run TypeScript check with 'tsc --noEmit' to verify fix." This structured debugging approach provides complete context, asks for explanation developing your understanding, requests comprehensive fixes updating all affected code, and includes verification steps preventing related issues.

Deployment readiness requires specific checklists. Before production, request comprehensive audits: "Prepare application for production deployment: 1) Security audit checking for exposed API keys, XSS vulnerabilities, CSRF protection, SQL injection prevention in database queries, rate limiting on public endpoints, proper CORS configuration, security headers with Helmet. 2) Performance optimization including bundle analysis identifying large dependencies, code splitting for routes, image optimization with proper formats (WebP with PNG fallback), font preloading, cache headers configuration, Service Worker for offline support, measuring Core Web Vitals achieving LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1. 3) SEO optimization with meta tags (title, description, Open Graph, Twitter Cards), sitemap.xml generation, robots.txt configuration, canonical URLs, structured data validation with Google's tool, mobile-friendly test passing. 4) Accessibility compliance using axe DevTools checking for issues, keyboard navigation testing, screen reader testing with NVDA, color contrast validation, focus management review. 5) Testing coverage ensuring unit tests \> 80% coverage, integration tests for critical paths, E2E tests for user journeys, load testing with k6 for expected traffic. 6) Monitoring setup including error tracking with Sentry, analytics with appropriate privacy compliance, uptime monitoring, performance monitoring with Web Vitals reporting, logging with structured logs. 7) Documentation including README with setup instructions, API documentation with OpenAPI spec, deployment guide, changelog, contribution guidelines." This comprehensive approach ensures production applications meet professional standards.
